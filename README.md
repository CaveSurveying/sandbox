# Sandbox

For experimenting with cave survey data

## Fake survex data 

This has a spiral so that the passage crosses over itself.  It is
geolocated so that the entrance is under the track down to Bull Pot
Farm (ha ha!).  Also provided is a cropped digital elevation model
(DEM) and a georeferenced cropped aerial image to match. The DEM is
taken from the OS Terrain 50 data set, (c) Crown Copyright and
