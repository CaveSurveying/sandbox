### Sandbox

For experimenting with cave survey data

## Fake survex data 

This has a spiral so that the passage crosses over itself.  It is
geolocated so that the entrance is under the track down to Bull Pot
Farm (ha ha!).  Also provided is a cropped digital elevation model
(DEM) from the OS Terrain 50 data set, and a cropped image of the OS
1:10k basemap.  Contains OS data (c) Crown Copyright and database
